# vls
ls replacement utility for UNIX

vls is a minimal tool intended as a replacement for the standard `ls` command.

File names are colorized based on type (directories, links and executables).
Pass `--no-color` to disable colored output.

## Building
Run `make` to compile the project. The resulting executable will be placed in `build/vls`.
